    <h1>Why Did I Study Physics?</h1>
    <p>Why did I study physics?  I had a choice:</p>
    <pre>physics ^ computer science</pre>
    <p>I was given the following advice:
    <blockquote>
        You can go into just about anything with a physics degree, but it's very hard to go into physics without one.
    </blockquote>
    - David Dorfan

<div class="slide">
<h1>My Job at Stanford</h1>
<p>I manage all of the IT needs for the Neurobiology department.</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 networks</li>
    <li>20 servers</li>
    <li>50 users</li>
    <li>100 desktops</li>
    <li>30 terabytes of data.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Future work</h1>
<p>I'm currently doing a job search.</p>
<p>I'm looking to move into a full-time development/engineering position.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>A day in the life</h1>
<p>My job can be divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Desktop support</li>
    <li>Server administration</li>
    <li>Software development</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Desktop Support</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This mostly involves setting up computers and helping people configure things.</li>
        <li>It is the least glamorous thing I do.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Server Administration</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Setup and installation of new servers.</li>
        <li>Configuration and monitoring.</li>
        <li>Network troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Software Development</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal web applications, e.g. presentation scheduling.</li>
        <li>Experiment control software.</li>
        <li>Other tools and utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Physics?</h2>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <h1>Why Physics?</h1>
    <p>So why get a physics degree instead of a computer science degree?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Why Physics?</h1>
    <p>CS teaches how things work and how they have been solved.</p>
    <p>It values explanation (what/how) over exploration (why).</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Why Physics?</h1>
    <p>Physics teaches how to derive general solutions to specific problems.<p>
    <p>Exploration leads to explanation.</p>
    <p>You will learn a lot of math.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Why Physics?</h1>
    <p>Physics teaches how to derive general solutions to specific problems.<p>
    <p>Exploration leads to explanation.</p>
    <p>You will learn a lot of math.</p>
    <p>And most of all, it teaches <span style="font-family: 'Bucket O Blood'; font-size: 200%;">Science!</span></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>An Example</h1>
    <p>Computer science does not teach variance or error.</p>
    <p>Many of them think that a single measurement is a valid source of data.  It is common in online literature.  As a physicist you will understand statistics in a way that most computer scientists don't.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Another Example</h1>
    <h2>The Program is Slow</h2>
    <p>How an (average) computer scientist investigates:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Users complain the system is slow.</li>
        <li>Programmer mucks with the code a little.</li>
        <li>Programmer tests application: it's a bit better.</li>
        <li>Programmer remembers something he read online.</li>
        <li>Programmer implements new technology: it's a bit better.</li>
        <li>Programmer claims the problem is fixed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After a few rounds of this the code becomes pretty bloated and unmaintainable.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Another Example</h1>
    <h2>The Program is Slow</h2>
    <p>How an real scientist investigates:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Users complain the system is slow.</li>
        <li>Scientist measures the application and sets a threshold for acceptable performance.</li>
        <li>Scientist takes measurements to determine the source.</li>
        <li>With the worst component identified, the scientist proposes a fix.</li>
        <li>The scientist implements the fix and takes new measurements.</li>
        <li>If the fix did not improve performance, it is removed, otherwise we go back to step 4.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Code is kept clean, as only that which makes a measurable improvement is used in production.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>An Example</h1>
    <p>This is a very mild example.<p>
    <p>There exist Net-Negative-Productivity Programmers (NNPPs).</p>
    <p>If you know how to think, your knowledge of specific technologies is a minor point.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide centered">
    <h2>What about you?</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>What about you?</h1>
    <p>So what does this all mean to you?  What if you want to pursue a career in technology?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Your Degree is Fine</h1>
    <p>Don't worry about whether or your degree looks good to employers on paper. They care more about what you have proven you can do than what you might be able to do.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Learn Math</h1>
    <p>If you are in any vaguely technical field, math is valuable.  Computer science was originally a branch of applied mathematics and it still is!</p>
    <p>One thing that separates great programmers from good programmers is the ability to reason at higher levels of abstraction and math is nothing but abstractions.</p>
    <p>I wish I had paid more attention in my linear algebra class.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Don't Worry About Specifics</h1>
    <p>Don't invest your time in specific technologies.  Invest your time in concepts, ideas, and practices.  The computer industry has many fads which come and go.  Look for resources that have stood the test of time.</p>
    <p>Play to your strengths as a problem solver.  Good, analytical thinkers are actually not that common.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Job Hunting is About Numbers</h1>
    <p>Don't get discouraged by rejections.  There are a lot of technology jobs out there and a lot of candidates.  It may take a while to find one that fits you.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <h1>A Final Thought</h1>
    <p><blockquote>"I'm pretty sure I only got the job because the CTO thought my degree was way cool."</blockquote> - Shawna Bushart, B.S. in Astrophysics, 2004<p>
