  <h1>Physics in Industry</h1>
  <h3>Drew Haven</h3>
  <h4>April 11, 2012</h4>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - UCSC</h1>
<p>Graduated UCSC in 2005 (7 years! Soon I won't be able to list all my experiences)</p>
<p>B.S. in Applied Physics, minor in Mathematics</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - After Graduation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Network setup at the SJCC: laid off after 3 months.</li>
<li>I tried some freelance web development: I made about $3k over six months = not enough for rent.</li>
<li>Employed as a web developer: Underpaid at a dying company. I left after 2 months.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Stanford</h1>
<p>Then, 10 months after graduation...</p>
<p>I landed a job at Stanford <em>through a friend</em> (who knew the hiring manager).</p>
<p>I managed the IT needs for the Neurobiology department.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Stanford</h1>
<p>This was a golden opportunity, so I ran with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned how to operate in a real job.</li>
<li>Learned enough to be come a passable programmer/sys-admin.</li>
<li>Very hands-off management.</li>
<li>Built very valuable experience and some great resume bullet points.</li>
<li>Stepping stone to the rest of the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Positive cash flow!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This job was how I broke into the industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Stanford (cont.)</h1>
<p>To fill in all the gaps in my CS knowledge I applied to Stanford for the computer science masters program, <em>and was accepted</em>!</p>
<p>Part-time classes while continuing to work at Stanford full time.</p>
<p>I expect I owe this to a professor I worked for who believed in me.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Visa</h1>
<p>In 2010 I left Stanford for a Software Engineer job at Visa.</p>
<p>Pretty typical enterprise Java programming job, and it didn't sit well with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terrible code.</li>
<li>Huge bureaucracy.</li>
<li>Lots of procedure.</li>
<li>Very risk adverse.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Consulting</h1>
<p>Last February I quit Visa and went freelance, working with an acquaintance in SF. (Who I met through a college roommate)</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary developer on <a href="http://www.facebook-studio.com">Facebook Studio</a></li>
<li>CTO of <a href="http://www.themml.com">The MML</a></li>
<li>Left both projects at the beginning of the year due to management differences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - Back to School</h1>
<p>Right now I am finishing up my MS full-time at Stanford.</p>
<p>I'm a TA as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Winter: Operating Systems</li>
<li>Spring: Web Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>I graduate this June, four years after I started.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - What's next?</h1>
<p>Signed offer from Google. I start in July.</p>
<p>I'll be a software engineer focusing on web services. The specific group hasn't been determined.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>My Experiences - What I learned</h1>
<p>If you're counting, that was about a year until I got my first good job.</p>
<p>Then four years before I had really established myself as a programmer. That's about 10,000 hours of practice (2000 / yr * 5 years).</p>
<p>My greatest opportunities came from social connections.</p>
<p>Finding a company that is a good cultural fit is hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Computer Science - Computer Science</h1>
<p>Physicists are well suited to computer science.</p>
<p>First, it's called computer <strong>science</strong> for a reason, but most programmers have no idea what that reason is.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Computer Science - Example</h1>
<h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>
<p>Let's take, for example, test driven development, which is popular enough that Visa is trying to adopt it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you implement a feature, write a test. The test should fail.</li>
<li>Write some code, then run the tests.</li>
<li>If the test passes, move on or write more tests. If it fails, go back to step 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Computer Science - Example</h1>
<h2>Test-Driven Development: Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies specifications</li>
<li>Enforces repeatability</li>
<li>Makes progress verifiable</li>
<li>Enforces quantifiable results</li>
</ul>
<p>A project lacking of any of these makes me queasy.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Computer Science</h1>
<h2>Software Engineering = Applied Science</h2>
<p>Software engineering is just another form of applied science.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The Tech Industry</h1>
<p>First off, it is doing very well.</p>
<ul>
<li>IT unemployment didn't go over 6% over the last three years. (9% national, 5.2% in IT)</li>
<li>The industry as a whole continues to grow. Valuations of companies are still increasing.</li>
<li>If you are talented, you will never be without work. You will learn to hate recruiters.</li>
<li>New ideas spring up every day.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The Tech Industry - Job Opportunities</h1>
<p>There are a <strong>lot</strong> of different jobs in the tech sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming - Build things people use!</li>
<li>Networking - Manage systems that feel almost alive.</li>
<li>Quality Assurance - Run experiments, gather data.</li>
<li>Analytics - Do complex simulations and analysis.</li>
<li>HCI - Learn how people interact with the world.</li>
<li>AI - Make computers smart.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The Tech Industry - Skills</h1>
<ul>
<li>Precision - Computers are notoriously unforgiving.</li>
<li>Mathematics - Any mathematics you know can be applied somewhere.</li>
<li>Troubleshooting - These are complex systems, and they fail in surprising ways.</li>
<li>Love of Learning - The industry is constantly changing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The Tech Industry - How to get the skills</h1>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the invariants: theory, mathematics.</li>
<li>Avoid focusing too much on specific technologies: they will be out-of-date in a few years.</li>
<li>Broaden your base: many topics have applications in other areas.</li>
<li>Get practice: Start working on your 10,000 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't expect to start knowing everything. Expect to learn as you go.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The Tech Industry - Start-Ups</h1>
<p>You are in a perfect position to join a start-up.</p>
<p>Few obligations, high energy.</p>
<p>It is riskier, but the reward is larger and the experience is valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>A Final Thought</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm pretty sure I only got the job because the CTO thought my degree was way cool.&quot;</p>
