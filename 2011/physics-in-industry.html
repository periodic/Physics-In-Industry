  <h2>What Happened to Me</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <p>Graduated UCSC in 2005</p>
  <p>Applied Physics, minor in Mathematics</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  I graduated from UCSC in 2005 with a major in Applied Physics and a minor in Mathematics
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>After Graduation</h1>
  <p>Moved over the hill to San Jose</p>
  <p>Network setup at the SJCC</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  After graduation I moved over to San Jose with a job lined up on a contract to do network setup at the San Jose Convention Center.  However, it didn't last very long.  When the number of conferences requiring networking dried up, my contract wasn't renewed.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>After Graduation</h1>
  <p>Freelance web development didn't work</p>
  <p>Employed web development didn't work</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  I tried to do some freelance web development, but that didn't work, and I learned just how unprepared I was.  I managed to land a job as a web developer, but that didn't work out either because the work environment wasn't very good and the pay was worse.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Stanford</h1>
  <p>Landed a job at Stanford through a friend</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  A friend pointed me to a job at Stanford that needed to be filled.  She helped me grease the wheels and a few months later I had a job that I would keep for four years.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Stanford</h1>
  <p>I managed the IT needs for the Neurobiology department.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>2 networks</li>
      <li>20 servers</li>
      <li>50 users</li>
      <li>100 desktops</li>
      <li>30 terabytes of data</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  I managed everything the Neurobiology department needed in terms of IT.  From desktop to support to server administration to software development.  It was a great job because I had the freedom to try whatever I wanted and had ample room to learn.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Stanford</h1>
  <p>It was my starter job.</p>
  <p>It was during this job that I actually became a reasonable programmer/sys-admin.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  Stanford was sort of a starter job for me.  It was really the job that launched my career.  It wasn't what I wanted to do long term, but it had a very important quality: It allowed me to learn.  I was able to really develop myself as a programmer and sys-admin at this job.  After about two years though, I felt like I was beginning to plateau in my learning.
</div>


<div class="slide">
  <h1>Stanford (cont.)</h1>
  <p>I enrolled at Stanford in the computer science masters program.</p>
  <p>Part-time classes while continuing to work at Stanford full time.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  I enrolled, with the help of recommendations from my managers, in the CS masters program at Stanford.  I did this because I felt like I had a lot of gaps in my CS knowledge from being self-taught and I wanted to close those holes.  I could theoretically have done more self-study, but I felt that I might miss a lot of things I didn't know were important.
  <br />
  Also, note that a masters in computer science is not like a masters in physics.  An MSCS is very valuable and people look on it highly.  It denotes a more focused study than a bachelors, and is commonly used by people going into industry, as a PhD is much more research oriented.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Visa</h1>
  <p>In 2010 I left Stanford for a Software Engineer job at Visa.</p>
  <p>Pretty typical enterprise Java programming job.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  Last summer I left Stanford and went to Visa, at the time it was just CyberSource, but they were bought by Visa last year shortly after I joined.  It was your fairly typical enterprise Java software engineering job.  I wanted to get more experience working on a team and working with professional code written by others.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Visa</h1>
  <p>In 2010 I left Stanford for a Software Engineer job at Visa.</p>
  <p>Pretty typical enterprise Java programming job.</p>
  <p>And it sucked</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  But I hated it.  Lots of process, too many meetings, and the code was horrible.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Consulting</h1>
  <p>In February I quit Visa and went freelance.</p>
  <p>Now working with a partner in SF.</p>
  <p>First site goes live <em>today</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  In February I quit Visa without a job lined up.  I knew though that I would either do consulting or join a startup.  The consulting thing worked out though as I connected with a guy who has been doing consulting for a while now and was looking for a partner to take on some larger projects.  I met him through an old college roommate who he is now married to.  Goes to show that some connections come from unlikely places.
  <br />
  Business has been good, and our first site goes live today.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>What's next?</h1>
  <p>Continuing with the consulting at least for a while.</p>
  <p>Projects lined up through the summer.</p>
  <p>Might go back to school full-time.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  For the future I haven't planned more than a year out.  We have projects lined up through the summer, and depending on how things work out I may go back to school full time to finish off my masters.  But if some of our independent projects take off, I might end up being too busy.  We'll just have to see how things work out.  That's part of the industry and consulting, it's hard to predict anything more than a few months out.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>If you're counting, that was about a year until I got my first good job.</p>
  <p>Then four years before I had really established myself as a programmer.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  If you were paying attention, you'll note it took me about a year to land my first real job, as in one that I was comfortable in, was paid well in, and wasn't about to lose due to forces outside my control.  It then took me about four years before I really established myself as a programmer enough to get through interviews for a mid-level position.  Perhaps I could have done those four years in college if I had had a CS degree instead, but I think in the end I'll end out on top.
</div>

## background 

I need to say up front that my experience has been fairly atypical.  I don't really represent a typical tech worker in the valley, and I can't really say how much of success has been due to luck.  Take anything I tell you with a grain of salt, check my sources, gather other data points.

Let me get the background out of the way.  You might be wondering who I am and what's actually interesting about me.  I'm not entirely sure, but hopefully my story will give you an idea of what life is like out of college and 

* I graduated from UCSC in 2005 with a major in Applied Physics, minor in Mathematics, but somewhere around my junior year I was sure I wanted to go into tech, and not into physics.
* I moved over into Silicon Valley with a contract job doing some network setup at the San Jose Convention Center.  It was a great opportunity, but the tech needs of conferences dried up and my contract was not renewed.
* With that ended I tried a few small web development jobs, but was unsuccessful getting any meaningful work with any good companies.  I thought I was better than I was, and it was very hard to find work without a portfolio to speak of.
* In 2006 I got a job at Stanford as the tech support for the Neurobiology department.  This was my big break.  I used the job to learn a lot about programming, systems administration, and tech support.  I was fortunate that they didn't mind having someone who was willing to learn as they went, and I was eager to learn.
* When my learning started to plateau after a few years, I got myself into the masters program at Stanford in computer science.  I was able to do it part-time while working.
* However, I still felt like I needed to keep moving my career forward, so last year I found a full time software engineer job at Visa, but I kept taking the Stanford classes, slowly working towards that degree.
* But that job was so unfulfilling and dysfunctional I left in February and started consulting.  I'm now working with another developer who I met through a roommate from UCSC.  We're currently wrapping up a project and so far things are going great.

If you're counting, that was about a year until I landed a real job, and then about five years before I landed a really good job.

  <h2>The Tech Industry</h2>
</div>


<div class="handout">
  Let me tell you a few quick things about the tech industry.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>The Tech Industry</h1>
  <p>First off, it is doing very well.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IT unemployment didn't go over 6% over the last three years.</li>
    <li>The industry as a whole continues to grow.</li>
    <li>Signs are that we may be entering another small bubble.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  The tech industry is doing really well.  It has continued to grow through the recession, and tech-sector unemployment never went over 6%.  It's an industry that has remained very healthy despite problems in the rest of the economy.  It definitely fared better than the financial sector.
  <br />
  From a personal stand-point, I get contacted by a recruiter about once every two weeks.  There are lots of jobs out there, and in the last two months I've already had to turn down half-a-dozen potential jobs because I'm already booked.
  <br />
  There are also some signs that we're entering another small bubble.  This is based on the size of valuations of tech companies recently, such as Google's $6 billion bid for Groupon.  This means that there is capital out there looking to invest in tech, which means even more businesses will be popping up over the next year, and that means more jobs and more opportunities.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Start-Ups</h1>
  <p>You are in a perfect position to join a start-up.</p>
  <p>Few obligations, high energy.</p>
  <p>Riskier, but the reward is larger and the experience is valuable.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  As a student right out of college, you also are in a good position to join a start-up.  Being fresh out of college I'm guessing few of you are married and even fewer have mortgages and large car payments to make.  This makes it easy for you to move, easy for you to put in the hours, and easier for you to deal with failure.  The potential payoff of a startup is large, but so are the risks.  However, if you factor in the experience and fulfillment, I believe it may be worth it.  That's why I quit my job at Visa.  I didn't know what was going to happen, and now I'm building a consulting business and some independent projects.  It's still early, but I think it was a perfect decision for me at this point.  In a few more years, if I had bought a house and settled down, I might not be able to do what I did now.
</div>


<!--
## The Tech Sector

Alright, now let me tell about this industry a bit.  First off, it's doing well.  The sector is growing and hiring, which is good news seeing as it really didn't lose much over the last few years.  When nationwide unemployment was at 9%, IT unemployment was at only 5.2%.  Valuations and investments have been steadly increasing lately though maybe with a touch of bubble to it, such as Google's $6 billion offer for Groupon.  All of this points to a healthy industry.

From a personal stand point, I haven't been able to go more than a few weeks without being contacted by a recruiter, and I've already had to turn down work in the last few months because I have enough lined up to last into the summer.

Also, as a recent college graduate you have are in a very unique position you probably won't be in ever again.  You are currently in the best position to join a startup.  Start-up companies are those that are taking venture capital and using it to try to make a product that is exponentially bigger than what they could make if they were just searching for something sustainable.  It has gotten easier and easier to launch startups as the web has expanded, computers have gotten faster, and programming has gotten easier.  The one thing startups need is investment, and if it's not money, it's time.  As a young person without a mortgage, or kids or many recurring bills, you have the ability to invest your time and energy, as I assume you're not sitting on a pile of cash you're looking to invest.  You're just over the hill from one of the best places in the world to start a company and there are many companies over there starting up and hiring.  It may not pan out, but it is an experience you can't really get anywhere-or any time-else.

<div class="slide centered">
  <h2>Computer Science</h2>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  So the tech sector is great and all, but what about this Physics degree you're about to get?
</div>


<div class="slide">
  <h1>Computer Science</h1>
  <p>Physicists are well suited to computer science.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  A physics degree isn't a loss if you go into tech.  In fact, I think it can be an advantage.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Computer Science</h1>
  <p>First, it's called computer <em>science</em> for a reason.</p>
  <p>Most programmers have no idea what that reason is.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  First off, remember, it's computer <em>science</em>.  It is a form of engineering, but computer science is so much more abstract and so much easier to experiment and test with that the science portion really stands out.  A good scientific mind can make a huge difference in the productivity and quality of a programmer.  Most programmers have little to no science training.  They learn their languages, APIs, and design patterns, but aren't taught how to design a good test or really find the root cause of a problem.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Example:Test-Driven Development</h1>
  <p>Let's take, for example, test driven development.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Before you implement a feature, write a test. The test should fail.</li>
    <li>Write some code, then run the tests.</li>
    <li>If the test passes, move on or write more tests.  If it fails, go back to step 2.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  There is currently a movement in the industry to adopt more test-driven development.  Some people say it's very useful, some say it's unnecessary, but it has been demonstrated to lead to better code in many cases.  The basic idea is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>Before you implement a feature, write a test. The test should fail.</li>
    <li>Write some code, then run the tests.</li>
    <li>If the test passes, move on or write more tests.  If it fails, go back to step 2.</li>
  </ol>
  Simple enough right?  And it may look a little familiar.
</div>


<div class="slide">
  <h1>Example: Test-Driven Development</h1>
  <p>Scientific method for programming</p>
  <p>Very hard to get adopted.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  It's basically the scientific method for programming.  Seems very useful, to have tests that tell you when the program works and when it doesn't.  However, it is very hard to get adopted.  Even after a mandate by executives to implement TDD, after six months at Visa I saw less than a dozen tests written by the four developers on my team.  We even had one person change the test to make it pass after a feature stopped working properly.  These were fully employed multi-year veterans of the company.
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Example: Statistics</h1>
  <p>When was the last time you saw a program spec quoted with a standard deviation or margin of error?</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  Another example is simple statistics.  Take the example of someone measuring the frames per second of their rendering system.  Most programmers will just display a number and probably eyeball it.  If they're good they'll take the average.  But if there is a huge difference between 30 FPS +/- 2 FPS and 32 FPS +/- 20 FPS.  Many people in the industry don't understand that.
</div>



<div class="slide">
  <h1>Software Engineering = Applied Science</h1>
  <p>Software engineering is just another form of applied science.</p>
</div>

<div class="handout">
  Software engineering is just another form of applied science.  All those job postings that say "Computer Science or related degree" are open to physicists.  The challenge is building up your programming skills, but that shouldn't be too hard.  After all, you got through a Physics degree.
</div>


<!--
## Computer SCIENCE

That's great and all, but what does it mean to you, a physics graduate?  Well, you have a skill that is sorely lacking in Computer Science.  It's fairly easy to get into computer science with a physics degree, but very hard to get into physics with a computer science degree.  Why?  Scientific thinking.

You probably already take it for granted, but the fact is that most software engineers out there have little to know science training.  They learn their languages, APIs, and design patterns, but they aren't tought critical problem solving skills, application of scientific thinking, and rudimentary probability and statistics.  

There is currently a movement in the industry to try to rigor to development through what they call Test Driven development.  Here's how it works:

* Before you write any code, you write a test.  The test should run the code in question and return whether it executed correctly or not.  At this point the test should fail.
* Then you write some code, and run your tests.
* If the tests pass, you move on to the next feature.  If it doesn't, you modify the code until it does.
Does this look familiar? You're forming a hypothesis (specification), forming a prediction (specific case) about how the code should work, creating an experiment (test), and then performing it (running the test) to verify or disproove (pass or fail) our hypothesis.

Sounds simple enough, right?  This is so foreign to many people that at Visa it was an executive mandate that we should do more TDD, yet in all my time there I saw a total of 4 tests written by all the developers on my team.  Simply having the ability to think in this manner and actually prove or disprove that your programs are correct will put you a step ahead of other developers towards writing quality code.

That's not even getting into measurement.  When was the last time you heard a performance spec listed with a standard deviation or margin of error?

Take the example of someone measuring the frames per second of their rendering system.  Most programmers will just display a number and probably eyeball it.  If they're good they'll take the average.  But if there is a huge difference between 30 FPS +/- 2 FPS and 32 FPS +/- 20 FPS. 

I won't go too deeply into the mathematics, but simply knowing what a graph (the nodes and edges kind) is will set you appart from 75% of employed career software engineers.
